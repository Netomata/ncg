Dependencies
------------
We haven't yet fully identified all of the dependencies of this
software; we apologize for that, and promise that we will do so
before making a general release.  

So far, we know about the following dependencies:

    Ruby
	We've been developing the code under Ruby 1.8.6.
	We haven't tried it under Ruby 1.9 yet; if you do, let us
	know how it works! ;-)

    Ruby Facets (http://facets.rubyforge.org/)
    	In particular, we make heavy use of the "Dictionary" class
	from the Facets collection of methods and libraries.  We've
	been using Facets version 2.4.1.  You can easily install
	Facets with the Ruby "gem" tool, if you have that set up as
	part of your Ruby installation:
		gem install facets

    ruby-debug (http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-debug/)
    	We've been using version 0.10.2 of this for our debugging.
	It's entirely possible that we've left some debugging code
	in there, which will fail if ruby-debug is missing on your
	system.  Ruby-debug can be easily installed with the Ruby
	"gem" tool:
		gem install ruby-debug

MacOS X 10.5.6 (Leopard)
========================

For whatever it's worth, most of the development has been done
under Mac OS X 10.5.6 (Leopard).  Beyond a basic MacOS X Leopard
installation, you need to do 3 things to do the same:

    1)  Install the "Xcode Tools" package from the "Optional Installs"
	folder on the MacOS 10.5 DVD, if you haven't already.

    2)  Set the following environment variables in your .bashrc or
	equivalent (we're not CERTAIN this is necessary, but it doesn't
	seem to hurt anything):

	export GEM_PATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8:/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8
	export GEM_HOME=/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8

    3)  Run the following commands as root to install the "facets"
    	and "ruby-debug" packages (discussed above):

	    gem update --system
	    gem update
	    gem install facets
	    gem install ruby-debug


Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid)
======================

The following commands create the necessary environment for ncg on a
Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid) system, assuming you use 'aptitude' for .deb package
management ('apt-get' instead of 'aptitude' should work just fine, too, with
the same arguments):

	aptitude install ruby rubygems ruby-dev libbreakpoint-ruby
	gem update
	gem install facets
	gem install ruby-debug
	gem install breakpoint

Similar commands would probably also do the trick for other versions of
Ubuntu, as well as for Debian Linux.
