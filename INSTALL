Installation and Removal Instructions
=====================================

Requirements
------------
Prerequisite tools that the software depends on are explained in
the "REQUIREMENTS" file.  In a nutshell, you need Ruby 1.8.6 (it
might work under later versions, but definitely won't work under
Ruby 1.8.5 or earlier; we haven't yet tested it under later versions
than Ruby 1.8.6), and the "hashery" Ruby gem.  We've also found the
"ruby-debug" gem to be very useful for debugging, but it is optional.

Installation
------------
1)  Unpack the distribution .tar file, and cd to the directory it creates.

	$ tar xvf ncg-0.10.3-rNNN.tar
	$ cd ncg-0.10.3-rNNN

1.1) OPTIONAL: run tests to verify that everything appears to work.

	$ ruby setup.rb test

2)  Configure your installation.

	$ ruby setup.rb config

3)  Check the resulting paths in the ".config" file.  If you want to
    change any of them, run "ruby setup.rb --help" to see what the
    options are, and then rerun "ruby setup.rb config" with additional
    arguments to regenerate the ".config" file.

    For instance, to install the 'ncg' script in /usr/local/bin, run

	$ ruby setup.rb config --prefix=/usr/local

    (NOTE: In this case, the Netomata libraries that 'ncg' depends upon
    will still default to being installed in your system's site-specific
    Ruby library path, which is often /usr/local/lib/site_ruby or a
    subdirectory thereof.)

    To install the 'ncg' script in /opt/netomata/bin and the libraries
    in /opt/netomata/lib, run

	$ ruby setup.rb config --prefix=/opt/netomata --rbdir=/opt/netomata/lib

    (NOTE: If you do this, and /opt/netomata/lib isn't part of your
    Ruby installation's standard library path, you'll also need to set
    the "NETOMATA_LIB" environment variable to "/opt/netomata/lib" or
    pass a "-L /opt/netomata/lib" argument to every invocation of "ncg",
    so that "ncg" will know where to find the libraries.)

4)  Do a dry run to see what's going to be installed where.  If you want to
    make any changes, go back to step 3.

   	$ ruby setup.rb install --no-harm

5)  When you are satisfied with the config, prepare your files for installation.

	$ ruby setup.rb setup

6)  Install the files (you may need to do this as root, depending on the
    permissions of the destination directories).

   	# ruby setup.rb install

Removal
-------
The "ruby setup.rb install" step of the installation process leaves
behind a file named "InstalledFiles" in the current directory,
containing the full path to all of the files created by the "install"
step.  To remove the software, simply remove all the files named in
"InstalledFiles":

	# rm -f `cat InstalledFiles`
