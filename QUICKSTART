QuickStart
==========
Here are the bare minimum things you need to do to get started with
Netomata Config Generator (NCG).

Prerequisites -- See the "REQUIREMENTS" file for details
--------------------------------------------------------
1)  Install Ruby 1.8.6 -- details vary by operating system (see
    "REQUIREMENTS" file)

2)  Install the "facets" Ruby Gem:

	# gem update
	# gem install facets

3)  (OPTIONAL) Install the "ruby-debug" and "breakpoint" Ruby Gems (useful
    for developing and debugging template code):

    	# gem install ruby-debug
	# gem install breakpoint

Installation -- See the "INSTALL" file for details
--------------------------------------------------
Unpack, configure, and install NCG:

	$ tar xvf ncg-0.9.1.rNNN.tar
	$ cd ncg-0.9.1-rNNN
	$ ruby setup.rb test
	$ ruby setup.rb config
	$ ruby setup.rb setup

	(do the following commands as root)
	# ruby setup.rb install

Try It  -- See the "examples/README.examples" file for details
--------------------------------------------------------------
In the "examples/switches" directory of the distribution, there is a fairly
simple examples configuration that generates config files for a pair of
Cisco router/switches providing active-active redundancy for a single-rack
web hosting environment.

1)  cd to the "examples/switches" directory in the distribution.
	
	cd examples/switches

2)  Run the following command (assuming the directory where ncg is installed
    is in your search path):

	ncg -v switches.neto

3)  Take a look at these files:

	configs/switch-1.config
	configs/switch-2.config

    Note that they are newly generated, that they are complete ready-to-install
    Cisco config files, and that they match the "baseline" config files that
    are included in the distribution:

	configs/switch-1.baseline
	configs/switch-2.baseline

4)  Start experimenting by reading through the "switches.neto" file, and
    working your way out from there.

A More Complex Example
----------------------
See the "examples/README.examples" file for a discussion of the
more complex set of NCG files and templates that generate a complete
set of Cisco switch/router, Nagios, and MRTG configs for a small
single-rack data center for an Internet-facing web service.
