QuickStart
==========
Here are the bare minimum things you need to do to get started with
Netomata Config Generator (NCG).

Prerequisites -- See the "REQUIREMENTS" file for details
--------------------------------------------------------
1)  Install Ruby 1.8.6 -- details vary by operating system (see
    "REQUIREMENTS" file)

2)  Install the "facets" Ruby Gem:

	# gem update
	# gem install facets

3)  (OPTIONAL) Install the "ruby-debug" and "breakpoint" Ruby Gems (useful
    for developing and debugging template code):

    	# gem install ruby-debug
	# gem install breakpoint

Installation -- See the "INSTALL" file for details
--------------------------------------------------
Unpack, configure, and install NCG:

	$ tar xvf ncg-0.10.1.rNNN.tar
	$ cd ncg-0.10.1-rNNN
	$ ruby setup.rb test
	$ ruby setup.rb config
	$ ruby setup.rb setup

	(do the following command as root)
	# ruby setup.rb install

Try It  -- See the "examples/README.examples" file for details
--------------------------------------------------------------
In the "examples/switches" directory of the distribution, there is
a fairly simple example configuration that generates config files
for a pair of Cisco router/switches providing active-active redundancy
for a single-rack web hosting environment.

The file "examples/switches/README.switches" contains background
information about the example, and a step by step walk through using
the tool in various ways, to illustrate its capabilities and benefits.

Once you've played with the basic "switches" example, there is a
more complex and complete (and applicable in the real world) example
in the "examples/web_hosting" subdirectory of the distribution,
which generates MRTG and Nagios config files as well as Cisco
switch/router configs for a small single-rack data center for an
Internet-facing web service.  For more information, see the
"examples/web_hosting/README.web_hosting" file.
