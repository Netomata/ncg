Requirements
------------
Dependencies are explained in the "Dependencies" file.  In a nutshell,
you need Ruby 1.8.6 (it might work under other versions, but we
haven't tested it under other versions), and the "facets" and
"ruby-debug" Ruby gems.

Installation
------------
1)  Unpack the distribution .tar file, and cd to the directory it creates.

	$ tar xvf ncg-0.9.0-rNNN.tar
	$ cd ncg-0.9.0-rNNN

1.1) OPTIONAL: run tests to verify that everything appears to work.

	$ ruby setup.rb test

2)  Configure your installation.

	$ ruby setup.rb config

3)  Check the resulting paths in the ".config" file.  If you want to
    change any of them, run "ruby setup.rb --help" to see what the
    options are, and then rerun "ruby setup.rb config" with additional
    arguments to regenerate the ".config" file.

    For instance, to install the 'ncg' script in /usr/local/bin, run

	$ ruby setup.rb config --prefix=/usr/local

    To install the 'ncg' script in /opt/netomata/bin and the libraries
    in /opt/netomata/lib, run

	$ ruby setup.rb config --prefix=/opt/netomata --rbdir=/opt/netomata/lib

    (NOTE: If you do this, and /opt/netomata/lib isn't part of your
    Ruby installation's standard library path, you'll also need to set
    the "NETOMATA_LIB" environment variable to "/opt/netomata/lib" or
    pass a "-L /opt/netomata/lib" argument to every invocation of "ncg",
    so that "ncg" will know where to find the libraries.)

4)  Do a dry run to see what's going to be installed where.  If you want to
    make any changes, go back to step 3.

   	$ ruby setup.rb install --no-harm

5)  When you are satisfied with the config, prepare your files for installation.

	$ ruby setup.rb setup

6)  Install the files (you may need to do this as root, depending on the
    permissions of the destination directories).

   	# ruby setup.rb install

Try It
------
1)  cd to the "sample" directory in the distribution.

2)  Run the following command:
	ncg -v sample.neto

3)  Take a look at these files:

	configs/switch-1.config
	configs/switch-2.config

    Note that they are newly generated, that they are complete ready-to-use
    Cisco config files, and that they match the "baseline" config files at:

	configs/switch-1.baseline
	configs/switch-2.baseline

4)  Start experimenting by reading through the "sample.neto" file, and
    working your way out from there.

More About the Sample Scenario
------------------------------

The sample scenario is a small single-rack data center for an
Internet-facing web service.  The scenario and associated network
design are more fully explained in pages in the Netomata wiki:

    http://www.netomata.com/wiki/web_hosting_example
    http://www.netomata.com/wiki/web_hosting_example_network_design

Briefly, the rack contains:

    2 Cisco 4948-10G switch/routers (48 ports of GigE and 2 of 10GigE),
	configured largely as mirror images of each other
    2 firewalls (make/model not yet specified) running in a redundant
	configuration
    2 load balancers (make/model not yet specified) running in a
    	redundant configuration
    12 (of a planned total of 24) 1U servers running Linux and Xen
	(with several Xen virtual Linux servers running on each of
	those real servers)

Currently, the "sample" directory contains a complete Netomata
config for the pair of Cisco 4948-10G switch/routers deployed in
an active/active configuration.  At this point, the sample setup
is only generating the configs for the switches; in future releases,
we plan to extend the sample so that it is also generating configs
for the firewalls and load balancers, as well as for DNS, SNMP
monitoring (i.e., Nagios), and SNMP trending (i.e., MRTG).
