This ALPHA version of the software is provided under a
Nondisclosure Agreement.  Please honor it.  Also, please
keep in mind that as an alpha release, this is definitely
_not_ suitable for production use yet.  Please play with
it, poke around at it, and tell us how it breaks or how
it falls short of your expectations, so that we can get
it up to snuff before general release.

Documentation is at http://www.netomata.com/docs
Please feel free to contribute to it... ;-)

Dependencies are discussed in the "Dependencies" file. 
In a nutshell, you need Ruby 1.8.6 (it might work under
other versions, but it hasn't been tested there), and
the "facets" and "ruby-debug" Ruby gems.

Try It
------

1)  cd to the directory where "ncg" is (at the moment, it only looks
    for its libraries and such in the current working directory; before
    the beta release, we'll set up environment variables for it to use
    to find its libraries and such).

2)  Run the following command (assumes that "." is in your search path):
	ncg -v sample/sample.neto

3)  Take a look at these file:
	sample/configs/switch-1.config
	sample/configs/switch-2.config
    Note that they're newly-generated, that they're complete ready-to-use
    Cisco config files, and that they match the "baseline" config files at:
	sample/configs/switch-1.baseline
	sample/configs/switch-2.baseline

4)  Start experimenting by reading through sample/sample.neto, and working
    your way out from there.

More About the Sample Scenario
------------------------------

The sample scenario is a small single-rack data center for an
Internet-facing web service.  The rack contains:

    2 Cisco 4948-10G switch/routers (48 ports of GigE and 2 of 10GigE),
	configured largely as mirror images of each other
    2 Cisco ASA 5510 firewalls (running as an active/standby pair)
    2 Cisco CSS 11501 load balancers (running as an active/standby pair)
    12 (of a planned total of 24) real servers running RedHat and Xen
	(several dozen Xen virtual RedHat servers run on those real servers)

Currently, the "sample" directory contains a complete Netomata
config for the pair of Cisco 4948-10G switch/routers deployed in
an active/active configuration.  At this point, the sample setup
is only generating the configs for the switches; before the beta
release, we plan to have it also generating configs for the firewalls
and load balancers, as well as for MRTG, Nagios, and DNS.
