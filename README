Requirements
------------
Dependencies are explained in the "Dependencies" file.  In a nutshell,
you need Ruby 1.8.6 (it might work under other versions, but we
haven't tested it under other versions), and the "facets" and
"ruby-debug" Ruby gems.

Installation
------------
1)  Unpack the distribution .tar file, and cd to the directory it creates.

	$ tar xvf ncg-0.9.0-rNNN.tar
	$ cd ncg-0.9.0-rNNN

1.1) OPTIONAL: run tests to verify that everything appears to work.

	$ ruby setup.rb test

2)  Configure your installation.

	$ ruby setup.rb config

3)  Check the resulting paths in the ".config" file.  If you want to
    change any of them, run "ruby setup.rb --help" to see what the
    options are, and then rerun "ruby setup.rb config" with additional
    arguments to regenerate the ".config" file.

    For instance, to install the 'ncg' script in /usr/local/bin, run

	$ ruby setup.rb config --prefix=/usr/local

    To install the 'ncg' script in /opt/netomata/bin and the libraries
    in /opt/netomata/lib, run

	$ ruby setup.rb config --prefix=/opt/netomata --rbdir=/opt/netomata/lib

    (NOTE: If you do this, and /opt/netomata/lib isn't part of your
    Ruby installation's standard library path, you'll also need to set
    the "NETOMATA_LIB" environment variable to "/opt/netomata/lib" or
    pass a "-L /opt/netomata/lib" argument to every invocation of "ncg",
    so that "ncg" will know where to find the libraries.)

4)  Do a dry run to see what's going to be installed where.  If you want to
    make any changes, go back to step 3.

   	$ ruby setup.rb install --no-harm

5)  When you are satisfied with the config, prepare your files for installation.

	$ ruby setup.rb setup

6)  Install the files (you may need to do this as root, depending on the
    permissions of the destination directories).

   	# ruby setup.rb install

Try It
------
1)  cd to the "sample" directory in the distribution.

2)  Run the following command:
	ncg -v sample.neto

3)  Take a look at these files:

	configs/switch-1.config
	configs/switch-2.config

    Note that they are newly generated, that they are complete ready-to-use
    Cisco config files, and that they match the "baseline" config files at:

	configs/switch-1.baseline
	configs/switch-2.baseline

4)  Start experimenting by reading through the "sample.neto" file, and
    working your way out from there.

More About the Sample Scenario
------------------------------

The sample scenario is a small single-rack data center for an
Internet-facing web service.  The rack contains:

    2 Cisco 4948-10G switch/routers (48 ports of GigE and 2 of 10GigE),
	configured largely as mirror images of each other
    2 Cisco ASA 5510 firewalls (running as an active/standby pair)
    2 Cisco CSS 11501 load balancers (running as an active/standby pair)
    12 (of a planned total of 24) real servers running RedHat and Xen
	(several dozen Xen virtual RedHat servers run on those real servers)

Currently, the "sample" directory contains a complete Netomata
config for the pair of Cisco 4948-10G switch/routers deployed in
an active/active configuration.  At this point, the sample setup
is only generating the configs for the switches; before the next
release, we plan to have it also generating configs for the firewalls
and load balancers, as well as for MRTG, Nagios, and DNS.
