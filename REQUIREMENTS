Requirements
============
This file documents the tools that NCG depends upon, as well as the
operating system platforms that it has been tested on.

Tools
-----
NCG depends upon the following tools, which need to be installed
before NCG will work:

    Required
    --------
    Ruby
	We've been developing the code under Ruby 1.8.6.
	We haven't tried it under Ruby 1.9 yet; if you do, let us
	know how it works! ;-)

    Ruby Facets (http://facets.rubyforge.org/)
    	In particular, we make heavy use of the "Dictionary" class
	from the Facets collection of methods and libraries.  We've
	been using Facets version 2.4.1.  You can easily install
	Facets with the Ruby "gem" tool, if you have that set up as
	part of your Ruby installation:
		gem install facets

    Optional
    --------
    ruby-debug (http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-debug/)
    	We've been using version 0.10.2 of this for our debugging.
	It's entirely possible that we've left some debugging code
	in there, which will fail if ruby-debug is missing on your
	system.  Ruby-debug can be easily installed with the Ruby
	"gem" tool:
		gem install ruby-debug

Operating Systems
=================
NCG should work just fine on pretty much any UNIX/Linux-based operating
system which has Ruby 1.8.6 available.  The notes below detail how to
install the necessary prerequisites on a variety of different platforms.

Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid) Linux
----------------------------
The following commands create the necessary environment for ncg on a
Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid) system, assuming you use 'aptitude' for .deb package
management ('apt-get' instead of 'aptitude' should work just fine, too, with
the same arguments):

	aptitude install ruby rubygems ruby-dev libbreakpoint-ruby
	gem update
	gem install facets
	gem install ruby-debug		# OPTIONAL
	gem install breakpoint		# OPTIONAL

Similar commands would probably also do the trick for other versions of
Ubuntu, as well as for Debian Linux.

MacOS X 10.5.6 (Leopard)
------------------------
Most of the development has been done under Mac OS X 10.5.6 (Leopard).
Beyond a basic Mac OS X Leopard installation, you need to do 3 things
to do the same:

    1)  Install the "Xcode Tools" package from the "Optional Installs"
	folder on the Mac OS 10.5 DVD, if you haven't already.

    2)  Set the following environment variables in your .bashrc or
	equivalent (we're not CERTAIN this is necessary, but it doesn't
	seem to hurt anything):

	export GEM_PATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8:/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8
	export GEM_HOME=/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8

    3)  Run the following commands as root to install the "facets"
    	and "ruby-debug" packages (discussed above):

	    gem update --system
	    gem update
	    gem install facets
	    gem install ruby-debug	# OPTIONAL

Windows
-------
We haven't yet tested NCG under any version of Windows.  If you try it, please
let us know how it works!
