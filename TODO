Before Beta:

Update License file and all headers

Set up license web pages
    http://www.netomata.com/license_v1
    http://www.netomata.com/license_beta_v1

Change all files headers to refer to license_beta_v1 instead of license_v1

----

Make file references in ".table" and ".include" relative to invoking file, 
not cwd.

Make "sample" independent of cwd.

Fix import_file and import_table to get rid of basekey?

Create Rakefile(s) for man pages
    Include nroff-formated output
    Include HTML-formatted output

Make <% ... %> assignments late-binding rather than early-binding

Make --dump generate output in .neto format, such that it could itself be
used as input.

Detect and deal with self-referenctial loops of form
	domain = <% "mgmt." + @target["(...)!domain"] %>

Figure out automatic way to check for existence of variables used in templates
	Some sort of mode switch on [] accesses, on when evaluating templates?

Add file/line info to error messages

Raise NetomataError for config errors
        Catch in Netomata::Template::Context for better error messages to user
        Flag other errors to be reported to Netomata, Inc. as bugs.
                Save somewhere, for easy reporting later?

Use missing_ (missing_instance_var, if there is such a thing?) methods in
template apply_* routines, to catch references to unpassed variables

Clean up VLAN code in sample/templates/configs/devices/routers/cisco/config.ncg
