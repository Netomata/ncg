Tasks not yet added to FogBugz
==============================
In bin/ncg rescue block, need to figure out some way to re-introduce target
context to backtrace.  Was previously printing stuff like
	while generating #{net[target_key]["ncg_output"]}
	for #{target_key}
in rescue block, but those are no longer in-scope since making the rescue
block cover more of the code.  Perhaps nested rescue blocks?

In import_template, parse files for "#@" keys to add,
or do some sort of equivalent trick with ERB

DRY open/filestack/close code

Create "metadata" method in utilities, and use that rather than
metadata pseudo-keys?

Prevent metadata set in node_store
