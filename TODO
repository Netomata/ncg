Tasks not yet added to FogBugz
==============================
Put RDOC documentation for methods online, and in distribution.

Add support for "ncg_idiom_keys" list to create a "search path" for "idioms".

Lock data tree before starting generation phase, to prevent anything in 
generation from modifying data in tree.

Add "version_check" directive in .neto files, to ensure late-enough version
with needed features is being used to process file.

In bin/ncg rescue block, need to figure out some way to re-introduce target
context to backtrace.  Was previously printing stuff like
	while generating #{net[target_key]["ncg_output"]}
	for #{target_key}
in rescue block, but those are no longer in-scope since making the rescue
block cover more of the code.  Perhaps nested rescue blocks?
