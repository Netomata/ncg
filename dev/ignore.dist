# List of files and directories to ignore when making distros
#
# Directory names should end in "/"
#
# All file and directory names are evaluated relative to top-level directory.
# In other words, if "RELEASE" is listed in this file but "sub/RELEASE" is
# not, then $top/RELEASE will be ignored, but $top/sub/RELEASE will _not_.
