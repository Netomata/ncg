Point-to-Point Links Example
============================

Let's say you're running a WAN made up of a series of point-to-point
links (T1 lines, VPN links, or whatever). You want a good way to
represent those links in your Netomata network model, so that it's
easy to add/drop/change links, while ensuring that all the right
data gets into the model.

For example, let's say you're running a point-to-point network for
a small company with main offices in San Francisco (SFO) and Los
Angeles (LAX), and branch offices in San Jose (SJC), Oakland (OAK),
San Diego (SAN), and Santa Barbara (SBA). Each main office (SFO and
LAX) has a Cisco 3640 router, and each branch office (SJC, OAK,
SAN, and SBA) has a Cisco 3620. Each branch office has a point-to-point
link to both main offices (SFO and LAX). There's also a point-to-point
link between the two main offices (SFO and LAX). (Never mind the
ridiculous economics of running all these point-to-point links;
imagine that they're all point-to-point VPN connections, if it makes
you happier. ;-) )
