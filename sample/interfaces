# name: interface name
# type: type of interface
# target1: name of device that's connected to this interface on switch-1
# active1: whether interface is active on switch-1 (default "no", not active)
# target2: name of device that's connected to this interface on switch-2
# active2: whether interface is active on switch-2 (default "no", not active)
#
# Note that fields in each row are tab-separated; number of fields must
# match (i.e., each row must have the right number of fields), even if the
# columns don't line up perfectly (because some names are longer than 8
# characters, for instance).  Multiple adjacent tabs are treated the same
# as a single tab (i.e., the field separator is /\t+/), so every field must
# have _something_ in it, even if it's just "-" or "none" or some such.
