Have ht.neto mkdir_p necessary config subdirectories

Define/use "management_fqdn"?

Clean up ht.neto; organize into parts by service?

Rename template files from, i.e., mrtg.ncg to mrtg.cfg.ncg ?

Reconcile difference in meaning between !devices!*!
	interface["name"] => interface name, something like "FastEthernet0/1"
	vlan-interface["name"] => VLAN name, something like "Management"
    Then clean up everywhere that VLAN name is constructed as "Vlan#{vli[id]}"
